Commands:
	cmake -S . -B /build/   			[source and build folders explicitly stated]
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" <path>	[specify what GENERATOR to use]
	cmake --build . 					[unified BUILD command]



glob vs list source files:
	Its best to explicitly list your files because the build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.
